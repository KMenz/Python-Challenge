# Python-Challenge

Python-Challenge is me analyzing two sets of data, PyBank and PyPoll. PyBank is mock financial data and PyPoll is data from a mock election.

I had to analyze and organize the data in order to get a set output from each dataset and then export the output to a .txt file, which is also in each folder.
